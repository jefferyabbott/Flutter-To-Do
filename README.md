# To Do
### Just a simple to do list app demonstrating how to use **Hive** for local persistence.

This project is very heavily influenced by Mitch Koko's Flutter tutorial (thank you - so good!) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ_ytw58tC4&t=6749s)

I had a conversation a couple of days ago in which someone asked me if I've ever had to troubleshoot a 3rd party library in Flutter/Dart. I actually laughed a little and was like, "what????... no." BUT, lo and behold I had to do exactly that in this project.



The Flutter Slidable library contains this:
#### **`flutter_slidable-3.1.1/src/notifications_old.dart`**

```
@override
int get hashCode => hashValues(tag, ratio); 
```

However, there doesn't appear to be any such function named hashValues.

*Yes, I will do further exploration and open a PR if I figure out that puzzle.*
